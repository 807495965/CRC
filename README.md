Colorectal cancer (CRC) development and treatment response are strongly influenced by the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). 
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as important regulators, but their clinical utility in CRC remains insufficiently defined.
We established a framework to identify immune-related lncRNAs (immLncRNAs) and explore their diagnostic and prognostic value. 
Analysis of CRC transcriptomes revealed core immLncRNAs that not only distinguished tumors from normal tissues but also stratified patients into two molecular subtypes with distinct immune landscapes.
One subtype exhibited features of “hot tumors”, characterized by immune activation and favorable outcomes, while the other represented “cold tumors” with suppressed immunity and poorer prognosis.
This classification underscores the role of ImmLncRNAs in shaping immune phenotypes and predicting patient survival. 
Our findings highlight immLncRNAs as promising biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets, and immLncSeek as a useful tool to guide biomarker discovery and personalized immunotherapy in CRC.
